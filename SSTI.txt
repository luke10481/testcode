In the context of Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), "sinks" refer to the locations in the template where user-supplied input can be injected and potentially executed as code. "Sources" refer to the points from which user-controlled data is retrieved and can be used as input for the injection.

Here are some common sources and sinks for popular template engines like Freemarker and Velocity:

Freemarker:

Sources:

User-supplied data from form inputs, query parameters, or cookies.
Data fetched from a database or external API.
File content read from the server or provided by the user.
Sinks:

Template variables: User-supplied data interpolated into template variables without proper sanitization.
Directives and expressions: User-supplied input within Freemarker directives or expressions that can be interpreted as code.
Velocity:

Sources:

User-supplied data from form inputs, query parameters, or cookies.
Data fetched from a database or external API.
File content read from the server or provided by the user.
Sinks:

Template variables: User-supplied data interpolated into template variables without proper sanitization.
Velocimacros: User-supplied input used to define or invoke macros, which can execute arbitrary code.
String interpolation: User-supplied data within string literals that can be interpreted as code.
In both Freemarker and Velocity, the sources are typically user-controlled inputs or data fetched from external sources. The sinks are the points where user-supplied input can be injected and potentially executed as part of the template rendering process.

To prevent SSTI vulnerabilities, it is crucial to properly validate, sanitize, and escape user input before it is used in templates. Templating engines often provide mechanisms to mitigate these risks, such as context-specific escaping, restricted environments, and disabling dangerous features. It is essential to follow the documentation and best practices of the specific template engine being used to ensure secure usage.









Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) occurs when an application allows user-supplied input to be directly included and executed within a server-side template. This can lead to various security vulnerabilities, including code injection, remote code execution, and data leakage. Here are some common scenarios where SSTI vulnerabilities may arise:

User Input in Template Variables: If an application allows user input to be directly inserted into template variables without proper validation or sanitization, it can lead to SSTI vulnerabilities. For example, if a web application uses Jinja2 or other template engines, and user input is directly interpolated into template variables without proper escaping, it can result in template code injection.

Dynamic Template Selection: If an application allows users to select or provide the name of a template file that is dynamically loaded and rendered, and this input is not properly validated or sanitized, it can result in SSTI vulnerabilities. Attackers can manipulate the template name to execute arbitrary code within the context of the template engine.

Template Inclusion: If an application allows user-controlled input to specify the inclusion of other templates, and this input is not properly validated or sanitized, it can lead to SSTI vulnerabilities. Attackers can provide malicious template names or paths to execute arbitrary code during the template rendering process.

Contextual Injection: Some template engines may provide features that allow code execution within specific contexts, such as Python expressions within a Jinja2 template. If user input is directly injected into these contexts without proper validation or sanitization, it can result in SSTI vulnerabilities.

It is important to implement proper input validation, sanitization, and context-specific escaping when working with server-side templates to prevent SSTI vulnerabilities. Additionally, keeping the template engine and its dependencies up to date helps mitigate known vulnerabilities in the engine itself. Regular security testing, including static code analysis and penetration testing, is recommended to identify and remediate SSTI vulnerabilities in applications.



Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerabilities can occur in various scenarios, particularly in web applications that utilize template engines like Freemarker and Velocity. SSTI is commonly exploited in the following scenarios:

Content Management Systems (CMS): SSTI vulnerabilities are often found in CMS platforms that allow users to create and modify templates. Attackers can manipulate user inputs or template variables to inject malicious code and execute arbitrary commands on the server.

User-Generated Content: Websites that allow users to submit or modify templates or content, such as blog platforms or forums, are prone to SSTI vulnerabilities. Attackers can craft malicious inputs that get rendered as templates, leading to code execution and potential server compromise.

Email Template Rendering: Systems that dynamically generate email templates based on user inputs may be vulnerable to SSTI attacks. If user-supplied data is directly interpolated into email templates without proper sanitization, it can result in SSTI vulnerabilities.

Custom Application Templating: Applications that implement custom templating systems using Freemarker or Velocity may introduce SSTI vulnerabilities if user inputs are not properly validated and sanitized before being rendered as templates.

It's important to note that SSTI vulnerabilities can arise in any scenario where user-controlled input is rendered within templates without appropriate precautions. Proper input validation, sanitization, and context-aware output encoding are essential to prevent SSTI attacks. Regular security assessments and staying up-to-date with security patches and best practices for the chosen template engine are recommended to mitigate these vulnerabilities.







When it comes to identifying vulnerabilities in Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) within template engines like Freemarker and Velocity, you can use a combination of black-box and white-box testing techniques. Here's how you can approach vulnerability discovery in both scenarios:

Black-Box Testing:

Input Fuzzing: Submit various input values, including special characters, long inputs, and unexpected data types, to test how the template engine handles them. Monitor the application's response for any unexpected behavior or error messages that might indicate potential SSTI vulnerabilities.

Template Breakage: Intentionally manipulate the template syntax or structure to determine if it leads to unexpected parsing errors or code execution. Explore how the template engine responds to unconventional or malformed input.

Contextual Testing: Test the behavior of the template engine within different rendering contexts. Assess how it handles different template constructs, such as variables, control structures, macros, and included templates. Look for any unexpected results or behaviors that might suggest SSTI vulnerabilities.

White-Box Testing:

Code Review: Analyze the template code and associated server-side code to identify potential security flaws. Look for places where user input is directly incorporated into templates without proper validation or sanitization. Check if appropriate output encoding is used before rendering user-controlled content.

Static Code Analysis: Employ static code analysis tools that specifically target template engines to identify potential vulnerabilities or insecure coding patterns. These tools can help detect issues such as untrusted input used in template rendering or unsafe context switching.

Configuration Audit: Review the configuration settings of the template engine to ensure that security features, such as sandboxing or restrictive mode, are properly enabled. Check if dangerous features or methods are disabled, and verify the default behavior and security settings.

Penetration Testing: Conduct targeted penetration testing, focusing on injecting malicious inputs into the application to identify any exploitable SSTI vulnerabilities. Attempt to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data by leveraging template injection.

Combining these approaches will help you identify potential SSTI vulnerabilities in template engines like Freemarker and Velocity. It is advisable to follow a comprehensive security testing strategy that encompasses both black-box and white-box techniques to maximize the effectiveness of vulnerability discovery.
